    Biography: I find it difficult to be wrong; as in I utterly detest anything which is even remotely
    removed from absolute perfection. As you can imagine, this means that when coding I spend a long
    time attempting to anticipate the inevitable flood of issues that will bear down upon my carefully
    constructed program.
      But alas, all that time simply can't be spared in the majority of cases: looming deadlines cast
    a dark shadow over my designs. But there really isn't much else to say about myself. I'm rather
    uninteresting.
      I suppose I better include some topic related accolades: I have been meticulously crafting
    a basic operating system for some time now; unfortunately, much of the work suddenly becomes
    obsolete in response to rapidly shifting design principles. I don't doubt that the project
    will quickly bear no resemblance at all to its original countenance.
      In addition I spend an inordinate amount of my time reading and writing. It isn't really
    related to the field, but this is my biography. But which is more than all these boasts can be:
    I live with total contempt for object oriented programming.
